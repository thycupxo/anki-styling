# anki-styling

Hi I use Anki to study Dutch. As you know, Anki interface is pretty outdated so to make it more visually pleasing and interesting to learn, this is the CSS code that I use to style the cards, buttons, and the horizontal line.

There are two types of cards I mainly use: The vocab card type (basic card with reversed side) and fill in the blank.

This is how the basic cards look like:

# Usage
Download the html and css files to your desktop then simply copy and paste the codeblock in the css to the styling section of the card. Copy the code placed under the 'Front Template' in the html code to the 'Front Template' and do the same for 'Back Template'. You can of course modify to your liking.
